*"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."* â€“ George Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905 (from the series Great Ideas of Western Man)

Recursion ~> DP

**When a problem is DP? When it is asked to**
* Count all possible ways
* The minimum / maximum way to do it

**To apply DP**
1. Represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index (according to the problem)
3. Sum of all stuffs / Minimum or Maximum of all stuffs

**Typically three ways to do DP**
* Memoization (Top-down)
* Tabulation  (Bottom-up)
* Space optimized way
